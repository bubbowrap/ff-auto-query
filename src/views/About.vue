    <h1>About Fanfiction Auto Query</h1>
    <p>
      If you've spent way too much time on the fanfiction site ArchiveOfOurOwn
      (AO3) like I have, you've probably run up against the issue of not being
      able to save your most used filters. Having to go through the painstaking
      process of including the things you want and excluding the things you
      don't want gets old
      <em>fast</em>, and if you have very specific tastes setting up each filter
      can easily take 1-2 minutes.

    <p>
      This app fixes that. Save and View all of your top visited queries in one
      central location and get some of your precious time back.
