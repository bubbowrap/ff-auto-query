    <p>
      If you've spent too much time on the fanfiction site ArchiveOfOurOwn (AO3)
      like I have, you've run up against the issue of not being able to save
      your most used filters. Having to go through the process of including the
      things you want and excluding the things you don't want gets old
      <em>fast</em>, and if you have very specific tastes setting up each filter
      can easily take 1-2 minutes.

    <p>
      This app fixes that. Save and View all of your top visited queries in one
      central location and get some of your precious time back.
